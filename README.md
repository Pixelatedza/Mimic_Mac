# Mimic_Mac
Auto Hotkey Script to mimic OSX shortcuts for editing text/code. (Very similar to BASH)

This script intercepts a lot of the Windows + X shortcuts to mimic Ctrl on OSX. So if you use them often, this will break them.

I suggest mapping Caps Lock to the windows key for maximum comfort.

## Shortcuts
| Shortcut  | Key(s) Pressed | Use |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Windows + P** | Up Arrow  | Previous line |
| **Windows + N** | Down Arrow  | Next line |
| **Windows + F** | Right Arrow  | Move forward one character |
| **Windows + B** | Left Arrow | Move backward one character |
| **Windows + E** | End  | End of line |
| **Windows + A** | Home  | Start of line |
| **Windows + K** | Shift + End, Delete  | Delete from cursor to the end of the line |
| **Windows + D** | Delete  | Delete character under cursor |
